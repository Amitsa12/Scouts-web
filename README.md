# Scout tribe

Final project on the website of the Scout tribe that allowed to manage personnel and tasks. 

In our project there are 2 types of users: admin and camper.


our project start like this :


![ Home page ](./.assets/HomePage.png)

There are 2 options, first to sign up to a specific gdud if you are new and the second is to log in for existing users.

![ Login page ](./.assets/Login.png)


If an admin has logged in, he goes to the home page of the system administrator, which includes all the functions that only an admin can

approve, such as adding tasks, seeing the tasks that each Gdud has and closing them if they are done, and adding and deleting users (administrator / camper).
